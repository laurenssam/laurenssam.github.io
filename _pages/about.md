I am a **PhD Researcher in Safety in Multimodal Large Language Models** at the University of Amsterdam, focusing on safety in multimodal generative models, red teaming, and bias in Large Language Models. Working under the supervision of Professor Yuki Asano and Professor Sennay Ghebreab.

In parallel, I am **Lead R&D LLMs** at the City of Amsterdam, leading an development team implementing LLMs throughout the organization and benchmarking them on bias, truthfulness, and sustainability in Dutch.
